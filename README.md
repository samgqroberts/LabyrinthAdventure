# LabyrinthAdventure

This was a project from July 2011, right after I started CS 101. Putting it up on Github for nostalgia purposes :')

Warning: there are some curse words in this project.

It's a single Java file with a main method. If you're running with JDK >11, you can simply run `java LabyrinthAdventure.java`. Otherwise: `javac LabyrinthAdventure.java && java LabyrinthAdventure`.
